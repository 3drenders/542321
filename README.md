*A simple grounding app to help with anxiety*

## How does it work?

The app is kept very simple, since itâ€™s designed to help you quickly in a moment of stress. When opening the app, youâ€™re guided through the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding method (also known as the *five senses method*). Youâ€™ll be asked to name:

- Five things you can see  
- Four things you can touch  
- Three things you can hear  
- Two things you can smell  
- One thing you can taste  

This technique is meant to shift your focus away from the anxiety youâ€™re feeling and help calm your mind. Hopefully, it helps!
